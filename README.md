# MongoDB DSLink

A DSLink for MongoDB.

## Usage

Ensure you have MongoDB installed somewhere. This can be on the server on which the link runs, or on a remote machine. See [this page](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) for how to install MongoDB.

Invoke `Add Database` and input a name and the URL. This would be something like `mongodb://127.0.0.1/dsa` if the you installed the server locally.

From there, you can create watch groups which allow you to setup a group of paths to subscribe.
